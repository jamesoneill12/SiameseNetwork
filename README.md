# SiameseNetwork
Creating a Siamese Network with Dynamic Time Warping on Labelled Sequences

# Description
The purpose of this Neural Network based project is to learn Compositional Distributed Semantic Vector representations 
using a Siamese architecture. Weights are tied between networks (network per sentence) when used for semantic relatedness, textual entailment
and paraphrasing. However, for asymmetric problems such as Information Retrieval (IR) where queries and corpus are coming from different data spaces.
